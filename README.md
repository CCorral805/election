Project 1 for Programming 1 Class in Java

Instructions:
Using the example from the lecture, create a bubble sort program in java. The program is broken down into 2 components, the first one is worth 5 points, the second one is worth 10 points. You must complete all of them to receive the full 15 points. Please use comments to detail which of the components you will be working on.

 

1) Create a java program that uses a fixed array and prints out the original array and the bubble sorted array. You must create a method to sort the array and a method to print the array; this method will be used to print both the unsorted and sorted array. (5 points)

2) Create a java program that prompts the user select between running a bubble sort on a fixed array (part 1 from above) or allow them to enter their own array (use ArrayList). Be sure to let the use know what character to enter when they are done building the custom array. You can assume that the user will only enter integers. You must then feed this array to the method created and print out the user's original array and the bubble sorted array.

 

Limitations: You may not use any built in java sorting methods from ArrayList or any other methods, you must create these yourself. You must be able to explain all code upon request.
